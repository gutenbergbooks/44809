observes the Day-by-Day-istical writer in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, "is
not to be confounded with his brother, Sir <span class="smcap">William Forwood</span>."
Why not? Why interfere with the liberty of speech on the part of some
Radicals, who might say "Confound 'em both!" Or, in the words of the
National Anthem, "Confound their politics."</p>

<p class="ph4">JOEYING AT THE PRINCE OF WALES'S.</p>

<p>There have been <span class="smcap">Joes</span> not a few on the stage. Coming down from
the time of <span class="smcap">Joe Grimaldi</span>, we pass on the way <i>Joseph Andrews</i>,
<i>Poll and Partner Joe</i>, <i>Poor Joe</i> from <i>Bleak House</i>, and many other
<span class="smcap">Joes</span> until we come to <i>Gentleman Joe</i>, hansom cab-driver,
played by <span class="smcap">Arthur Roberts</span>. The question and answer in the old
idiotic nigger song applies appropriately here, with slight adaptation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">What! <i>de</i> <span class="smcap">Joe</span>? Yes! <i>de</i> <span class="smcap">Joe</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spruce <span class="smcap">Joe</span> kicking up ahind and afore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Kitty Loftus</span> playing up to Mister <span class="smcap">Joe</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And with the assistance of the always graceful <span class="smcap">Phyllis
Broughton</span>&mdash;of whom <i>Gentleman Joe</i> might have sung, but doesn't,
"<span class="smcap">Phyllis</span> is my only <i>Fare</i>"&mdash;aided also by the pretty-voiced
<span class="smcap">Lettie Searle</span>, helped by the sprightly earnestness of Miss
<span class="smcap">Clara Jecks</span>, who has turned over a new leaf and come out as a
page, and kept moving by the dashing "go" of Miss <span class="smcap">Sadie Jerome</span>
(not at all a "sad eye" nor a "say die" sort of young lady) as <i>Lalage
Potts</i>, this two-act musical farce, beginning as a kind of <i>High Life
below Stairs</i> and ending anyhow, offering, as it does, opportunities
to Our Only <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> for introducing into it any amount of
"divarsion" in the way of new songs, eccentric speeches, nods, winks,
becks, and wreathed smiles, may be continuing its successful career in
the summer of '96, there being no apparent reason why its run should
ever stop, that is as long as <i>Gentleman Arthur Joe Roberts</i> handles
the ribands as the popular <i>Cabbing-it Minister</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">A New Title.</span>&mdash;Our <span class="smcap">Grace</span>, the cricketer, is not made
a "Sir" or raised to a dukedom. There is, however, in view of present
craze, a great chance for conferring the greater honour on a champion
bicyclist. His title would be "The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wheelington</span>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="ph4">SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Dividend Deserved.</span>&mdash;The Glasgow Town Council has been
running its own tram-cars for a year past, and has cleared more than
Â£20,000 of profit for the citizens out of the business. There is huge
rejoicing on the Clyde, and no wonder, as the result is due to sheer
good management, without over-charging the public or over-driving the
drivers. The Tramways Committee reports:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Further, the Committee have given effect to what they believe to
be the general feeling of the citizens&mdash;viz., that the cars, which
necessarily form a notable feature of the streets of the city,
should not only be tasteful in design and colour, and comfortable
for passengers, but also that their general appearance should not be
marred or their destinations obscured by advertisements.</p></div>

<p>Moral for many southern railway, tram, and omnibus companies&mdash;Go and do
likewise! Moral for Glasgow citizens&mdash;Get carried over your tram-lines
often enough, and you'll carry over a big dividend to decrease your
next year's rates!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Sub-lime!</span>&mdash;This is how "business" is transacted by some of the
Youghal Town Commissioners. The question was&mdash;who should supply them
with lime!</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Mr. Kennedy.</i> I propose that thirty-nine barrels be bought and paid
for.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Loughlan.</i> I propose that he supply the lime at 1<i>s.</i> per barrel.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Long</i> (<i>warmly</i>). I say the Board can't do anything of the kind.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Loughlan.</i> You'll get choked if you don't keep cool (<i>laughter</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mr. Long</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). Take care of your windpipe (<i>laughter</i>). I
suppose he gave you a few good lumps of lime (<i>loud laughter</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mr. Loughlan</i> (<i>jumping up excitedly</i>). Now that is a gross insult.</p>

<p><i>The Chairman.</i> Order, order, gentlemen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Youghal's worried chairman raised a cry of "Order!"&mdash;when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lump of old white limestone took him in the abdomen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he smiled a wan official smile and walked out at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tongues of <span class="smcap">Long</span> and <span class="smcap">Loughlan</span> interested him no more.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Porkers and Paupers.</span>&mdash;Bath Workhouse pigs "live on the best of
good cheer" in the form and substance of milk, so the municipal pork
and rate-aided bacon ought to be prime. The <i>Bristol Mercury</i> reports a
meeting of the Bath guardians, when</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Manchip</span> called attention to the fact that some of the
children did not even touch their milk gruel and dry bread which
was served out for breakfast. On Friday morning when the visitors
were at the Workhouse at seven o'clock two buckets of milk gruel
were taken out to the pigs. Mr. <span class="smcap">Manchip</span> proposed that the
Medical Officer be asked if he would be good enough at his earliest
convenience to consider whether a change could be made in the
children's diet. The Chairman thought if the gruel was sweetened with
a spoonful of treacle the children would then like it. It was agreed
to give the Chairman's suggestion a fortnight's trial.</p></div>

<p>Congratulations to the Bath children on being e-manchip-ated from their
old diet!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>For securing "absolute impartiality" in conferring the prizes at the
Llanelly National Eisteddfod, the judges had "a pit dug for them,"
into which they disappeared during the progress of competitions,
so that participators could not "fix them with a glittering
eye," and compel them (by hypnotic means) to award a prize. Sir
<span class="smcap">Joseph Barnby</span>&mdash;warbling, <i>sotto voce</i>, "This is my time for
disappearing"&mdash;greatly enjoyed these dives to the bottom of the well
in search of Truth, and no doubt the novel departure "assisted" the
blindness of Justice. But, so far as dignity is concerned, "Oh! the
pit-y of it."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We read of a cooky at Claughton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In music she was a self-taught'un;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But her mistress, I fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Said 'twas nothing but beer<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that caused her cook to vociferate hymns and, in her harmonious
enthusiasm, to return home towards midnight and hammer loudly at the
door. We know not whether this melodious <i>cuisiniÃ¨re's</i> recipe for
cleaning fire-irons "with a wet rag and a bucket of water" is to be
found in Mrs. <span class="smcap">Glasse's</span> <i>Art of Cookery</i>, but the learned Judge
decided in favour of the mistress, against whom <span class="smcap">Mary Rogers</span> (a
poetical name forsooth) brought an action for unjustifiable dismissal.
Alas! poor cook. She must, henceforward, do her stewing without singing
and her "mashes" without melody.</p>

<p>When Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry McCalmont</span> gives "receptions" they will be

<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh! Liza.</span>"&mdash;Another subject for <span class="smcap">Chevalier</span>. A special
meeting was held in Liverpool to protest against the presence of
Cockney costers who, it was asserted, seriously injured the business
of Liverpudlian "market-tenants." Mr. <span class="smcap">Walker</span> (is he of the
celebrated Hookey branch of the family?) averred that he had "seen a
coster with his barrow standing before the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor's</span> shop
for half-an-hour." Our sympathetic soul weeps at this gross injustice
to the worthy syndic, and we trust it will not cost-er him too much.
But, as the lawyer remarked, <i>de costibus non est disputandum</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> notifies a novelty in return tickets introduced

<p class="ph4">LA GÃOGRAPHIE DE LONDRES.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ã Monsieur Punch.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;<i>Je viens d'arriver</i>&mdash;but hold! I go to write in
english, which I know enough well. I am come to London to this Congress
of Geographs. I cross the Sleeve&mdash;<i>la Manche</i>, how say you? Ah <i>la
douleureuse traversÃ©e</i>, the dolorous traversy! In fine, the train
arrives at a station. I seek, I regard, I read the soap, the mustard,
the other <i>rÃ©clames</i>&mdash;how say you?&mdash;but not the name of the station.
Then a cry, "Londonbridg!" Ah, it is the station of London! <i>Sapristi</i>,
how she is little this station! <i>La gare de Londres</i> no more great than
a station of <i>banlieue</i>, near to Paris. Eh well, I descend immediately.
I seek my baggages, I go to find a <i>fiacre</i>, a "ansom." Then in English
I say to the coacher, "George Street, Number Forty." "OlraÃ¯ttseu," say
he. What is this that this is that that? I comprehend not. But all of
same I mount in carriage and we part.</p>

<p>Soon we arrive. Hold! This is a street of commerce; there is there but
offices. And not of number forty.</p>

<p>"Nottir, maounsiah?" say the coacher. Ah, I comprehend! "No," say I,
"not here." "Minnoriss," say he. "How?" say I; but we are in road.
Hold! Again a street of commerce&mdash;but of the most villain. I anger
myself. I cry, "Coacher, I have said you George Street." "OlraÃ¯tt,
maounsiah," say he, "this is George Street." "Not here," I respond. "Is
there two George Streets?" Then he swear, he laugh; he ask that he may
be blown; he say more, that I comprehend not. In fine, he say, "Taoua
Ill." Again a George Street. But here some warehouses only. Then the
coacher say, "Shoditch," and we go. Again a George Street! Still more
small! Again one time I anger myself. I ask to him, "Where go you?" He
say, "Which George Street is it?" I say, "George Street, London." Then
he laugh again, and he swear; and he say, "Ollaouai." Again a George
Street! <i>Tiens, c'est embÃªtant!</i> But it is but a street of commerce,
and very little. "Islingtonn," say he. What! again a George Street?
<i>Sapristi! Quelle ville!</i> If they love the name of George, these
English! But, no, still a poor little street. "BlakfraÃ¯ahs," say the
coacher. We traverse some streets, some streets, without end! In fine,
see there number forty. But it is a little shop. <i>Mille tonnerres! Pas
encore!</i> "Youstonn Road," say he. Again some streets, some streets,
without end! And again a street of commerce. And again the number forty
is a shop! <i>SacrÃ© nom d'une pipe!</i> "Lissn Grov," say he. Again some
<i>kilomÃ¨tres</i> to traverse. What! Again a George Street? How many of them
is there, of these George Streets? And again, as you say in english,
"No go." But all of same we go, for the coacher say "Manshestasquaiah."
I shut myself the eyes, and I repose myself.</p>

<p>Ah, that values better! In fine, a better street. And see, there number
forty! What joy! In fine, I arrive. How it is fatiguing, this course
in London, long of three hours or more! I descend. I demand my friend.
What? He live not here? He is gone? <i>A la bonne heure!</i> "One more," say
the coacher. "What," I cry, "again a George Street?" "Yess, maounsiah,
Annovasquaiah." Then this one is not the house of my friend, this one
is not the George Street that I seek! <i>Que le diable enlÃ¨ve</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But we continue, we arrive, in fine, it is here. All exhausted I
descend. How much pays one the course in London? In Paris it is 1Â·50.
Ah! in London it must be one shilling and half. This one has been a
long course; I go to give a good <i>pourboire</i>, one shilling. I offer
to the cabman two shillings and half. Then he cry, he swear, he
descend, he wish to fight me. I say, "It is not enough? How much?"
He say, "Tenbobb." What is this that this is that that? In fine, my
friends come from the house, they explain that that wishes to say,
"Ten shillings," they say he has reason, and I pay him. It costs dear
the cab of London. But it is equal to me, for now I go to pronounce a
discourse before the Geographical Congress on the George Streets of
London. He will be of the most interestings, of the most curious. I beg
you, Mister <i>Punch</i>, to make me the honour of to come to hear him, and
to agree the assurance of my sentiments the most distinguished.</p>

<p class="ph4">THE POLITICAL UGLY DUCKLING.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragments of a Brummagem Fairy Tale.</i>)</p>

<p>It was in a big town in the Midlands that the Ugly Duckling first
chipped shell. "<i>Cheek! Cheek! Cheek!</i>" squeaked the youngster as he
crept out. How big and ugly he was, to be sure! Not a bit like the
other ducklings. In fact he was a portent, and a puzzle.</p>

<p>However, the ugly, grey-coated youngster, took to the water, and swam
about like the rest. "He's every inch my own child, after all," said
the old duck. "And really he's very pretty, when one comes to look at
him attentively. Quack! quack!" added she; "now, come along, and I'll
take you into high society. Now move on, and mind you cackle properly,
and bow your head before that old duck yonder, who is the noblest born
of them all. Now bend your neck, and say 'Quack!'"</p>

<p>But the Ugly Duckling was an odd bird, as well as an ill-favoured one,
and gave much trouble and excited much jealousy in the duck-yard. He
quacked indeed, but he would not bend his head or bow to the old duck
properly.</p>

<p>"He remained too long in the egg-shell," mused the maternal bird; "and
therefore his figure, like his manners, is not properly formed on the
true duck model. But as he's a male duck it won't matter so much. I
think he'll prove strong, and be able to fight his way through the
world." Which was true.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>But at first the Ugly Duckling had a baddish time of it. He was bitten,
pushed about, and made game of, not only by the ducks, but by the hens.
They all declared he was much too big, and fancied himself too much.
He certainly was not graceful, and he had a cocky, self-assertive
air which irritated the Conservative Old Cockalorums. He was always
making unexpected and unducklike sorties, "alarums and excursions,"
and lifting up his raucus-caucus voice against the time-honoured rules
and respectable conventions of the duck-pond. So much so, that they
nicknamed him the "Daring Duckling," and prophesied that he would come
to a bad end.</p>

<p>So he ran away, and flew over the palings.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>


<p>He had many adventures, and various. He dwelt for a time with a lot
of wild ducks in a marsh, and even struck up a sort of friendship
for a swarm of wild geese, who wanted to do away with domestication
and destroy the "tame villatic" tendencies of gregarious goosedom,
and abolish barn-yards and duck-ponds, peacocks, and game-fowls, and
guinea-hens, and poulterer's shops, and <i>pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras</i>, and other
checks on liberty and incentives to luxury. But somehow he didn't get
on with the wild ducks for long. He was so much wilder than they, and
wanted his own way too much and too often for the old and recognised
leaders of their flocks. And as to the wild geese, why he soon lost
sympathy with their "revolutionary programmes" and "subversive
schemes," which he learned to regard indeed as a sort of wild goose
chase, and deride and denounce as vehemently as he had aforetime
praised them.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take my chance, and go abroad into the wide world," said
the Duckling.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>


<p>One evening, just as the sun was setting, there came a whole flock of
beautiful large birds from a grove. The Ugly Duckling had never seen
any so lovely before. They were dazzlingly white, with long graceful
necks: they were swans. They uttered a peculiar cry, and then spread
their magnificent wings and away they flew from this cold country to
warmer lands across the open sea, as was their usual custom. They rose
so high that the Ugly Duckling felt a strange sensation come over him,
a sort of delicious vertigo. He turned round and round in the water
like a wheel, stretched his neck up into the air toward them, and
uttered so loud and strange a cry that he was frightened at it himself.
Oh! never could he again forget those beautiful, happy birds, so
gracefully fleeting against a primrose sky. He knew not how those birds
were called, nor whither they were bound, but he felt an affection for
them, such as he had never yet experienced for any living creature.
And he more and more lost love for, and patience with, all his old
associates, ducks or geese, wild or domesticated.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>


<p>The Ugly Duckling now felt able to flap his wings. They rustled much
louder than before, and bore him away most sturdily; and before long he
found himself in a noble park, a nobleman's park; indeed, the dainty
demesne of one of those who "toil not neither do they spin." It was
quite Beaconsfieldian in its beauty, with its smooth emerald sward and
umbrageous elm-avenues, its dusky cedar clumps and tail-spreading,
crest-sunning peacocks.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" mused the Ugly Duckling. "It is strange, but <i>I feel quite
at home here!!!</i>"</p>

<p>Three magnificent white swans now emerged from the thicket before him;
they flapped their wings and then swam lightly on the surface of the
water. The larger one (whose beak bore the letter S as a "nick") was
dark and haughty of mien, the second (whose beak was branded B) was
slim and exceeding graceful; whilst the third, a solid and even rather
sullen-looking bird, was beak-stamped with a legible D.</p>

<p>"I will fly towards these royal birds," cried the Ugly Duckling. And he
flew into the water, and swam towards those stately swans, who turned
to meet him with sail-like wings the moment they saw him.</p>

<p>"Why, he is one of us!" said the darker and statelier of the three.
"Almost!" he added, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>The Ugly Duckling was startled at the remark. But looking at his
reflection in the smooth lake he was more startled still. His own image
was to his eyes no longer that of the Daring Duckling, much less of the
Ugly One. It was smart, smooth, sleek, swelling, in fact swan-like!!!
At any rate, he thought so, and so, indeed, the other three swans
seemed to think.</p>

<p>He preened his feathers, and puffed forth his plumes. He flapped his
wings, and arched his neck, as he cried in the fullness of his heart:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of such happiness when I was the Brummagem Ugly
Duckling."</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>


<p>It matters not being born in a duck-yard if one is hatched from a
swan's egg!</p>

</a></div>

<p><i>In Leisure Time</i>, by <span class="smcap">W. S. Mavor</span> (<span class="smcap">Elliot Stock</span>) is,
so my Baronite reports, a daintily-bound little volume of blameless
verse, unambitious, as may be inferred from its title. The author
writes like a classical scholar, his lines are fluent and melodious,
his metre and rhyme unimpeachable, while some of the poems, such as
"Zaleucus" and "A Vision," rise distinctly above the general level.
In others there are passages which my Baronite&mdash;a sadly prosaic and
matter-of-fact person&mdash;owns to having found slightly obscure.</p>

<p>For example, in the following couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In vain the fickle demon sports<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fetid remnants of decay."<br /></span>
</div></div>



<p>He quite failed to discover what particular&mdash;or rather anything <i>but</i>
particular&mdash;demon is referred to, or why he should amuse himself in so
eccentric and unpleasant a manner.</p>

<p>Nor, my Baronite says, was his conception of contentment greatly
assisted by this somewhat complicated comparison:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Contentment is a love-commissioned barque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailing a self-less sea&mdash;a sea whose flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ordered alway by the laughing guns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Virtue's fortalice, whose armament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Primed with rose-petal powder, doth discharge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In generous rounds of sympathy with all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattering happiness, whose smile betrays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pangless hurt."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But that, he is quite willing to admit, may be rather the fault of his
own imagination than the poet's. Again, in a poem entitled "Love's
Messengers," the author writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Flit thou along on softly feathered feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noiseless, thou shadowy-pinioned minister,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gently fan, <i>with midnight gale</i>, my sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Lest thou awaken her."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which, to my Baronite, suggests the difficulty that, if the minister
fans the lady with his shadowy pinions "gently," he will fail to
produce anything resembling a "midnight gale"; on the other hand, if he
performs the part of invisible punkah so energetically as to suggest
a gale, he can hardly help awakening her unless she is a very heavy
sleeper indeed&mdash;and <i>might</i> give her a cold in the head. Surely this is
rather an unfair dilemma on which to place a feathered minister of any
denomination.</p>

<p>But after all, poetry, as my Baronite fully recognises, is not meant to
be judged by so literal a standard, and it may be cheerfully conceded
that there are many people who make a less profitable use of their
"Leisure Time" than Mr. <span class="smcap">Mavor</span> has done. In which opinion
concurs</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Notes for an Additional Chapter to the History of Hullibulgaria.</i>)</p>

<p>The Deputation did their very best. They were most anxious to make
things smooth. "He whom they desired to obey" would wear an inferior
sort of crown, robes of cotton-backed velvet, trimmed with imitation
fur. He would not give away orders&mdash;he would only take them. He would
not command the army, save as an agent acting under direction from the
Master. There is nothing he would not do to secure the goodwill of his
great, his benevolent, his all-powerful Master.</p>

<p>The Bear was very amiable. The Bear was pleased with the Deputation
and with the nation they represented. And having said this, there was
nothing further for the Bear to say.</p>

<p>"But, most powerful of powers, most clement of sovereignties," urged
the Deputation, "there is another matter needing decision. How about
the Prince?"</p>

<p>"What Prince?" softly murmured the Bear, in a tone of curiosity
combined with astonishment.</p>

<p>"The Prince we wish to serve," explained the Deputation; "the Prince
who desires to serve you."</p>

<p>"Have you read the Treaty of Berlin?" asked Bruin. "It is a most
excellent agreement, and deserves special attention. Does the name of
any Prince appear therein?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Deputation; "and the same painful omission is
observable in the <i>Almanac de Gotha</i>. So we would petition on our
knees that the painful omission should be supplied. We ask that the

It was disappointing to His Highness, but not to the Editor of the

<p><i>Little Dives.</i> "<span class="smcap">Oh, by the way, Belairs&mdash;awfully sorry to cut
you out, you know&mdash;but I've just proposed to Lady Barbara, and she's
accepted me, and we're to be married in September. And look here, Old
Chappie; I want you to be my Best Man. I want to make a good Show at
the Altar, you know!</span>"</p></div>

<p><br />I was immensely struck, a few days ago, by a passage in a speech
recently delivered by the Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, in
which he explained his method of dispelling those passing fits of
ill-temper from which, alas! not even Archbishops are wholly free. "At
times," so ran the report of His Grace's words, "anger or irritation
came upon him, but on the table he kept a book of pleasant poems,
of which he would read a few lines, and the irritation would melt
away." Immediately I determined to follow this noble example. It was
unfortunate that the "book of pleasant poems" was not described more
specifically&mdash;could it be the verses of Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Christopher
Benson</span>?&mdash;but I bought a pocket volume of <i>Selections from the
Great Poets</i>, which contained enough variety to suit every case, and
then looked out for an opportunity of trying the Archbishop's plan.</p>

<p>I had not long to wait. That very evening I came across my uncle
<span class="smcap">Robert</span> at Clapham Junction, in a furious rage at having
just missed the last train to Slowborough, where he lives. At once
I produced my volume, and in slow and emphatic accents I read aloud
some three or four hundred lines from "Paradise Lost." I was about
to add one or two of <span class="smcap">Wordsworth's</span> sonnets, when I realised
that my uncle had long since disappeared, and that I was surrounded
by a jeering crowd, who evidently supposed me to be a member of the
Salvation Army.</p>

<p>On the following morning I received a visit from <span class="smcap">Snips</span>, my
tailor. He was impolite enough to suggest a settlement of what he
termed my "small account," a demand, as I politely but plainly assured
him, which was altogether absurd. As he showed distinct symptoms of
irritation at this juncture, I began to read him a scene from <i>Measure
for Measure</i>. Strangely enough, this seemed only to irritate him
further, and I understand that he intends to take proceedings against
me in the County Court. This second unaccountable failure of the
Archbishop's remedy greatly surprised and pained me, but I decided to
give it another trial.</p>

<p>This morning I was playing golf with my friend <span class="smcap">Macfoozle</span>.
At no time a skilful golfer, <span class="smcap">Macfoozle's</span> form to-day was
worse than ever; whenever he made a bad stroke&mdash;and he seldom made
a good one&mdash;he indulged in the most violent language. Fortunately
my volume of poetry was in my pocket. When he completely missed his
drive at the second hole, I read him <span class="smcap">Coleridge's</span> <i>Dejection</i>.
When he broke his mashie at the fourth, I treated him with copious
selections from <i>In Memoriam</i>. Finally, he got badly bunkered while
playing to the fourteenth hole. For some ten minutes he smote furiously
with his niblick, only raising prodigious clouds of sand as the
result of his efforts. This was clearly a golden opportunity for the
Archbishop's cure, "anger and irritation" but faintly represented
<span class="smcap">Macfoozle's</span> rage. Seating myself on the edge of the bunker,
I began to read aloud <i>The Ring and the Book</i> with the utmost pathos.
Over what followed I prefer to draw a veil. It is enough to say that a
niblick is a very effective weapon, and that I write these lines in bed.</p>

<p>When I recover, I really must call at Lambeth for fuller directions.
The archiepiscopal remedy for angry passions does not seem invariably
happy in its results, as far as my experience goes.</p>

<p class="ph4">ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</p>

<p>In a biographical sketch of the late Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Julius Hawley
Seelye</span>, formerly President of Amherst College, in America, I
read that "Amherst made him President notwithstanding considerable
opposition in the faculty. He soon overcame that, and advanced the
prosperity of the College in the accessions to its faculty and
endowments that he secured. He soon required the students to sign an
agreement to be gentlemen. A violation of the pledge resulted in the
termination of their careers at Amherst." This sounds strange, for it
would appear that if no pledge had been given the students might have
behaved as they liked, without terminating their careers. The idea of
solemnly pledging yourself to be a gentleman is quite colossal.</p>

<p>The Independent Labour Party is not dead yet. It is forming clubs,
just like any ordinary humdrum party. The <i>Western Daily Press</i>
reports that "At a special meeting held at <span class="smcap">Lee's</span> Coffee
Tavern, Bath Bridge, last night, when there were present Mr. <span class="smcap">W.
S. M. Knight</span>, president of the Bristol South Independent Labour
Party (in the chair), Messrs. <span class="smcap">A. Browne</span>, <span class="smcap">E. B. Hack</span>,
<span class="smcap">C. Vale</span>, <span class="smcap">C. F. Brocklehurst</span>, <span class="smcap">T. Pole</span>, <span class="smcap">C.
Parker</span>, and <span class="smcap">W. Price</span>, it was unanimously decided to open
a club for Totterdown and the East Ward of Bedminster in connection
with the Independent Labour Party. Officers and a committee were
appointed, and suitable headquarters for the club were decided upon."
Nothing could be more appropriate. Totterdown suggests decrepitude and
failure (in this case at least), and Bedminster hints at repose and
peace. I offer the suggestion and the hint gratis to the Independent
Labour Windbags.</p>

<p>The Loveday Street Canal Bridge (which is, I fancy, in Birmingham) is
evidently a demon bridge with a depraved taste for injuring children.
One day last week it threw <span class="smcap">John Chick</span>, aged seven, off and
broke one of his legs. About five hours later, resenting an attempt on
the part of <span class="smcap">Thomas Walton</span>, aged twelve, to climb it, it flung
him off on to the towing-path and injured his back. A few days before
that it had precipitated the same <span class="smcap">Thomas Walton</span> into the
water, whence he was rescued with some difficulty. Evidently this is a
bridge with an ungovernable temper, and the authorities should guard it
efficiently.</p>

<p><i>The Scotsman</i> informs me that "speaking the other day at Haddington,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> glanced scathingly at those politicians of the
baser sort who seek to confuse great issues by dragging to the front
petty or irrelevant questions, and the breath of whose nostrils is
the disturbance of the harmony which should subsist between class
and class of the community." On this two questions arise. The first
is how Mr. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>, an amiable gentleman, managed to glance
scathingly. To scath, as I learn from the dictionary, means to hurt,
to injure; and, personally, I cannot imagine Mr. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>
infusing very much venom into a mere glance of his expressive eye. The
second question is how politicians, even of the baser sort, can go on
living when their unfortunate lungs are filled with a disturbance of
harmony. That they should have sufficient strength left to drag to the
front petty or irrelevant questions is nothing short of a marvel, due
allowance being made for metaphors.</p>

<p>A golfer is in trouble, and has confided his difficulties to <i>Golf</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whilst playing on the links at Streetly, on July 16, he drove a ball,
which apparently fell clear, but which for some time could not be
found. After some little hunting it was discovered under a small tuft
of heather in a lark's nest, resting on the back of a young lark,
apparently about four days old, together with three lark's eggs,
which were quite intact. The golfer was obliged, of course, to lift
the ball and place it behind, as it would have been gross cruelty to
have played it from the nest. It was match play. Under the exceptional
circumstances was he bound to lose the hole? The editor replies that
if a player were a stickler for the law and nothing but the law, he,
of course, would be entitled to enforce it against his opponent who
found the ball in the nest.</p></div>

<p>There has been some excitement at Weston-super-Mare. The "Conservative
party organized a reception for the Hon. <span class="smcap">G. H. Jolliffe</span> on his
first appearance in the town since his election for the Wells division.
Arrangements were made for those intending to take part in the
procession to meet the hon. gentleman at the Potteries on his return
from Banwell Horse Show at 7 p.m., but he arrived in the town a quarter
of an hour too early, and scores of enthusiasts were disappointed.
Those, however, who happened to be early enough followed the hon.
gentleman, some on foot and others in cabs, to the Royal Hotel, the
Town Band heading the procession. Mr. <span class="smcap">Jolliffe</span> rode on a coach
drawn by four horses, and was supported by several of the leaders of
the party in the town. Subsequently he addressed those assembled."
But if Mr. <span class="smcap">Jolliffe</span> rode on a coach, why was it necessary to
support him? Moreover, seeing that it was a four-horse affair, it seems
unjust that the leaders should be talked of and that no mention at all
should be made of the wheelers.</p>
